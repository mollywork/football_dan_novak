    <div class="row">
      <p>Bennie “Buster’’ Abram III died his first day of practice as a defensive back for the University of Mississippi.</p>

      <p>As winter workouts began Feb. 19, 2010, Abram told the coaching staff he felt under the weather and requested to not participate, according to documents from a wrongful death lawsuit. But coaches told Abram, a 20-year-old community college transfer student and walk-on, that if he didn’t join his teammates, he would be off the team.</p>

      <p>After stretching and a half-mile run, players performed strength and agility drills at 10 different stations, which some Ole Miss players described as the hardest offseason workout. Abram collapsed after the first station and was castigated by coaches and pushed to continue, court documents say.</p>

      <p>At the second station, he again collapsed and was helped to the sidelines. As players lined up for wind sprints, Abram was transported to the hospital and died later that day.</p>

      <p>Abram was one of 22 Division I football players between 2000 and 2018 to die from an exertion-related illness suffered during a workout or practice, according to an analysis by the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism and The Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism at the University of Maryland. The causes of death include collapse from sickle cell trait, heatstroke and sudden cardiac arrest.</p>

      <p>Across all of collegiate athletics, far more football players have died from these conditions than other athletes, according to data compiled by the National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research at the University of North Carolina.</p>

      <p>Exertion-related deaths result from intense exercise and are preventable with smarter, better-planned workouts, according to reform advocates.</p>

      <p>Critics say the NCAA has not done enough to protect collegiate athletes from dangerous and sometimes fatal workouts. Coaches overseeing practices that result in the deaths of players are almost never fired from their positions, and even if they are, sometimes go on to new positions at different programs, according to an analysis by the Howard and Povich centers.</p>

      <p>The NCAA strictly regulates recruiting violations and improper payments to athletes. From 2014 to 2018, the NCAA found 152 infractions of student-athletes receiving financial aid or payment, or other recruiting violations. The NCAA has not levied penalties on any of the 22 athletic programs that had a player die on its watch, but has made changes in response to the deaths of athletes.</p>

      <p>When players die, football programs often defend themselves by blaming the athletes or asserting whatever workout caused the illness was the same as any other -- as the University of Central Florida did following the death of Ereck Plancher and Northwestern University did after Rashidi Wheeler died.</p>

      <p>“It’s preventable death,” said Devard Darling, former player at Florida State whose twin brother and teammate Devaughn died from a conditioning workout in 2001. “And it’s under the hands and in the care of these coaches and trainers who are supposed to be there to take care of us. You go into family’s homes, you sit down, you talk to their parents, you tell them how you’re going to take care of them and help them become men, and this and that. No one sends their kids off to school to die.”</p>

      <p>Institutions have paid out tens of millions in settlements to victims’ families, including $3.5 million in January to the family of Jordan McNair, a University of Maryland player who died from heatstroke in 2018.</p>

      <p>The NCAA has made incremental progress in protecting athletes over the past two decades. But even the NCAA acknowledges it needs to do more to hold individuals and institutions accountable.</p>

      <p>NCAA Chief Medical Officer Brian Hainline recognized there is a “gap” when it comes to holding coaches and programs responsible.</p>

      <p>“That’s sort of the next step ... how do we actually legislate health and safety?” Hainline said in an interview.</p>

      <p>No Ole Miss trainer, coach or athletic department staff member was deemed to be responsible for Abram’s death, either by the university or the NCAA. Team personnel did not break any NCAA rules when conducting the training regimen that led to Abram’s death, and the university claimed athletics personnel followed NCAA best practices in caring for an athlete with sickle cell trait.</p>

      <p>The Rebels’ head strength and conditioning coach, Don Decker, was subsequently named that year’s Collegiate Strength and Conditioning Coach of the Year by the Professional Football Strength and Conditioning Coaches Association.</p>

      <p>“Unfortunately almost all the deaths come from just completely inappropriate strength and conditioning sessions. That’s the single biggest cause presenting all those conditions,” said Douglas Casa, CEO of the Korey Stringer Institute at the University of Connecticut, which educates youth, high school, collegiate and professional athletes on how to prevent illnesses and death that result from exertion. The institute is named after the former Minnesota Vikings offensive lineman who died from heatstroke in 2001.</p>

      <p>“It’s such a travesty that we allow these big-time college programs to abuse these athletes,” said Casa, also a Ph.D. of exercise physiology.</p>

      <p>A 2017 NCAA investigation resulted in Ole Miss forfeiting all of its wins spanning six seasons, including the year Abram died. The infraction? “An unconstrained culture of booster involvement in football recruiting.”</p>

      <p>“This is an association … that enforces all kinds of frivolous rules, like preventing players from receiving a free meal from a third party, or a shelter, or entering into a name, image and likeness deal,” said Ramogi Huma, executive director of the National College Players Association, a nonprofit organization that advocates for student-athletes’ rights. Huma founded the organization while he was a football player for UCLA in the late 1990s.</p>

      <p>“You have to question whether or not the colleges and the NCAA prioritizes players’ health,” he said. “And absolutely not. It doesn’t.”</p>

      <p>Often, intense conditioning drills are grounded in a masculine football culture with the belief that hard workouts build toughness and team character.</p>

      <p>University of Maryland head coach DJ Durkin told the Carroll County Times in 2016 that he tried to make summer practices as hard as possible. "The heat makes cowards out of us all,” he said. “We're working on some mental toughness, and that's what we're going to do.”</p>

      <p>Two years later, when McNair, a Maryland offensive lineman, became ill while running sprints, head athletic trainer Wes Robinson reportedly yelled to “get him the (expletive) up” and “drag his ass across the field.”</p>

      <p>Abram was not in poor physical fitness before starting at Ole Miss. He had been playing football for Itawamba Community College in rural Mississippi, and subsequently received several scholarship offers.</p>

      <p>After making the Rebels, Abram, like every football player, underwent an extensive medical evaluation. A blood test revealed he carried the sickle cell trait, like roughly 8% of the African American population. But according to the lawsuit, neither he nor his family was ever informed.</p>

      <p>According to the National Athletic Trainers’ Association, although carrying the gene is benign, intense and sustained physical stress can cause red blood cells of those with the trait to change shape and reduce blood flow — similar to the red blood cells of people who suffer from sickle cell anemia. This reduction in blood flow can lead to rapid breakdown of muscle tissue and cell death.</p>

      <p>“I was able to work hard and do everything, it was the recovery part that got me,” Darling said, who like his twin brother, also carries the sickle cell trait but is able to manage his symptoms. “I’ve had a career, I’ve worked just as hard as anyone out there. It’s just knowing your body. Awareness and being educated is the biggest thing.”</p>

      <p>Darling went on to play five years in the NFL and currently runs a foundation teaching young athletes and the public about the sickle cell trait.</p>

      <p>An analysis by the Povich and Howard centers found that from 2000 to 2010, nine Division I football players with sickle cell trait died. In 2019, 49% of Division I football players were Black and are at far greater risk of carrying the trait than players of other races and ethnicities. Of the 22 players to die from exertion since 2000, all but two were Black.</p>

      <p>The NCAA did not start mandating schools to test for sickle cell trait until August 2010 as a part of a wrongful death settlement on behalf of Rice University player Dale Lloyd II, who died in 2006. One player has died from a sickling collapse in the 10 years since testing began.</p>

      <p>Abram’s family received $50,000 from the insurance company for Mississippi's athletic foundation and $275,000 from the NCAA’s insurance policy in a settlement. Since 2000, Division I institutions have paid more than $29.5 million to resolve 12 wrongful death and negligence lawsuits, either through settlements or court order.</p>

      <p>Eleven families received money in damages on behalf of their sons who died from either sickle cell trait collapse or exertional heatstroke. One family settled a lawsuit after a player died from an exercise-induced asthma attack. Three lawsuits were settled for undisclosed amounts and are not included in the above figure.</p>

      <p>The largest settlement was $16 million for the death of Rashidi Wheeler at Northwestern University, a private school. It can be harder to bring lawsuits against public universities, where sovereign immunity protects states from being tried in civil court and caps damages.</p>

      <p>The family of Ereck Plancher, a player from the University of Central Florida who died in 2008, was awarded $10 million in a wrongful death lawsuit that was decided by a jury trial. However, the university athletic association appealed the case to the Florida Supreme Court, which limited the damages to $200,000 due to sovereign immunity.</p>

      <p>“A couple hundred thousand dollars ain’t much of a deterrent to make you do anything when your program brings in $200 million,” said Eugene Egdorf, an attorney who represented the Abram and Lloyd families.</p>

      <p>Just two deaths of a football player from indirect causes — Tyler Heintz at Kent State University in 2017 and McNair at the University of Maryland in 2018 — led to dismissals of team staff.</p>

      <p>After Heintz died of heatstroke, it was discovered that strength and conditioning coach Ross Bowsher, who was supervising the drills that led to Heintz’s death, falsified his professional certification. Nonetheless, the university claimed, “the workout was conducted in accordance with national protocols for student-athlete health and safety.”</p>

      <p>At Maryland, it was only after news reports and an internal investigation found McNair had not been properly treated for heatstroke and coaches created a culture of abuse on the team that the university fired four members of the training and coaching staff.</p>

      <p>Durkin, football head strength and conditioning coach Rick Court, Robinson and assistant athletic director of athletic training Steve Nordwall were all dismissed, but only after details of McNair’s improper care went public following his death. Durkin was eventually reinstated by the University System of Maryland Board of Regents, but UMD President Wallace Loh fired him shortly thereafter. Durkin received at least $5 million in severance pay and found an assistant coaching job less than two years later at Ole Miss.</p>

      <p>One coach oversaw conditioning sessions that led to two players’ deaths. Robert Jackson was the trainer at the University of Central Florida in 2008 when Plancher collapsed in an offseason workout from sickle cell trait and died. Jackson later became the head football trainer at the University of California, Berkeley, where another player, Ted Agu, died of sickling collapse in 2014.</p>

      <p>A spokesman for California-Berkeley would not provide the Howard Center with any details surrounding Jackson’s hiring, but said the athletic department was “aware that Mr. Jackson was an assistant trainer at UCF” when Plancher died.</p>

      <p>As Plancher struggled during a conditioning session, UCF head coach George O’Leary ordered water and trainers to be removed from the practice facility, according to three players who testified in court. O’Leary and three other players disputed this in their testimony.</p>

      <p>The Orlando Sentinel reported O’Leary swore at Plancher when he collapsed during the workout, which included a 75-minute weightlifting session, sprints and agility drills. “I remember having blurred vision when I was trying to do the offensive drills,” Cody Minnich, a UCF player who participated in the workout, testified in court. “The majority of it was just spent like being dizzy.”</p>

      <p>UCF Athletic Director Keith Tribble, a University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame inductee as a former offensive guard, called the workout “basic” during a press conference the day of Plancher’s death.</p>

      <p>Plancher, like Abram, was not informed he had sickle cell trait, a lawsuit states. Nine months later, another UCF player collapsed at practice and was hospitalized with kidney failure. O’Leary stayed on to coach at UCF until 2015 and is now immortalized with a statue outside UCF’s Bounce House stadium.</p>

      <p>In 2001, Wheeler, the Northwestern safety, collapsed while running a set of wind sprints during preseason conditioning tests. Coroners ruled his death was caused by exercise-induced asthma. Days after his death, Northwestern head coach Randy Walker said, “I have no doubt a better-conditioned athlete is a whole lot more likely to survive the game of football. I didn’t write the rules. But it is a rigorous sport.”</p>

      <p>On a day in 2005 when media were invited to watch a voluntary practice at the University of Missouri, linebacker Aaron O’Neal showed signs of fatigue during agility exercises. He complained of blurry vision and dropped to his hands and knees, but coaches told him to repeat the drill three more times. After O’Neal fell unconscious, staff took him to the team offices. He was taken to the hospital and died shortly after he arrived — about 90 minutes after the workout ended, a delay that may have cost him his life.</p>

      <p>“Killing a player in a hazardous workout is not against the rules,” Huma said. “Physically assaulting a player is not against NCAA rules.”</p>

      <p>Fatal accidents from football have significantly decreased since the 1960s and 1970s because of rule changes to make the game safer, protecting athletes from head and neck injuries. But deaths from overexertion started spiking when the sport “went from seasonal to year-round training” around 2000, said Scott Anderson, head athletic trainer at the University of Oklahoma and president of the College Athletic Trainers’ Society. According to his research about offseason training, six football players across all NCAA divisions died from traumatic injuries between 2000 and 2016.</p>

      <p>According to an analysis by the Povich and Howard centers, eight football players died of exertion-related illnesses on the first day of practice following a break or offseason. Athletic training professionals say the first week of activity can be risky if coaches rush into overly strenuous workouts for players who may be out of football shape following an offseason. Workouts with no basis in sports science cause these illnesses, Anderson said.</p>

      <p>“The onus is upon the strength coaches for those workouts,” he said. “They should be planned, there should be some sport-specificity there, there should be some exercise-science basis, and there should be consideration for individual risk factors.”</p>

      <p>In May 2018, the 19-year-old McNair, a 325-pound lineman, suffered heatstroke while running 10 110-yard sprints. McNair was not treated promptly enough, his body was unable to recover and he died two weeks later.</p>

      <p>Medical experts have found preventing heatstroke death is simple, provided training staff can identify the problem and immerse the player in an ice bath. The survival rate for an athlete with heat-related illness is 100% if their body temperature is brought below 104 degrees within 10 minutes of a medical event.</p>

      <p>During football workouts, players are often grouped together regardless of size, ability or conditioning level, and all are expected to perform the same drills, according to Casa. McNair, a lineman who would never sprint longer than a few seconds on a single play over the course of an actual game, was running the same sprints as smaller players like receivers and backs, according to a University of Maryland investigation.</p>

      <p>Most players who suffer from heat illness are big, heavy players. Although practicing in high heat and humidity is an added risk, Casa said, athletes will adjust to the weather over the first seven to 10 days of practice if workouts are safe and players are provided with enough time to rest and hydrate.</p>

      <p>Anderson said McNair, Abram and other players should never be put in the position to suffer heatstroke or sickle cell collapse in the first place.</p>

      <p>“Is there an exercise science that says 110 yards is the magic number?” Anderson said. “Is there an exercise science in terms of how fast it should be run? Is there an exercise science that says how many should be run? Is there an exercise science about what the rest and recovery should be? Is there an exercise science behind this? And the answer is no.”</p>

      <p>Other serious muscular and skeletal conditions can result from dangerous conditioning sessions. At the University of Iowa in 2011,13 players were hospitalized with rhabdomyolysis after a weightlifting session that included 100 squats at 50% maximum weight. The workout demonstrated to the coaching staff “who wanted to be on the team,” according to a university investigation.</p>

      <p>Frequently caused by extreme physical stress, rhabdomyolysis causes a severe breakdown of muscle tissue, which can result in kidney failure and death, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Other rhabdomyolysis outbreaks occurred at the University of Oregon in 2017 and the University of Nebraska in 2018.</p>

      <p>“If any of them had sickle cell trait, they very possibly could have died that day,” Casa said.</p>

      <p>Iowa strength and conditioning coach Chris Doyle was named a master strength and conditioning coach by the Collegiate Strength and Conditioning Coaches Association in 2012. He eventually became the highest-paid strength coach in the country before leaving Iowa in June 2020 after multiple allegations of racial bias among players.</p>

      <p>When Agu, the defensive lineman for California-Berkeley, collapsed from repeated sprints up and down a hill while holding a rope, his death was originally attributed to a sudden cardiac arrest from an abnormally thick heart. After reading players' accounts with more detailed circumstances of his collapse, the medical examiner changed the cause of death to sickle cell trait.</p>

      <p>It can be difficult to differentiate the cause of death among heatstroke, sickle cell collapse and cardiac death, although autopsies have improved in recent years, according to Kim Harmon, head football physician at the University of Washington and a leading expert on cardiac issues in athletes. Leading critics like Anderson and Casa are adamant that many exertional sickle cell deaths are wrongly attributed to heart problems.</p>

      <p>The Howard and Povich centers found that seven players’ deaths since 2000 were ruled as sudden cardiac failures, the leading cause of death during exercise for all college athletes. According to Harmon’s research, sudden cardiac death among athletes is primarily brought about by underlying heart conditions. But Anderson argues that although exertion is not the sole cause of cardiac arrest, almost all sudden cardiac deaths among college football players occur during practice and conditioning sessions, proving exertion is a trigger.</p>

      <p>“It’s almost a sigh of relief [when an autopsy is ruled a cardiac failure],” Anderson said. “That’s God’s fault, we can’t be held accountable for that. But we can potentially be held accountable for exertional heatstroke, we can be held accountable potentially for exertional sickling, we can be held accountable potentially for asthma death. But cardiac, who could have known? Who could have done anything about that?”</p>

      <p>Just one lawsuit has been brought stemming from a player dying of sudden cardiac arrest, and it was dismissed.</p>

      <p>Along with the rule mandating that players be tested for sickle cell trait, the NCAA has taken some steps to mitigate exertional deaths, with mixed success.</p>

      <p>In 2003, the NCAA passed several rules governing preseason practice time, including restrictions on two-a-day practices (which the NCAA has since banned) and limits on the number of daily practice hours. The NCAA also started requiring a mandatory five-day acclimatization period for football players to build fitness as preseason practice begins. Before 2003, one to two heatstroke deaths occurred during August practices each year, according to research in the Journal of Athletic Training.</p>

      <p> since then, one player died during the first week of preseason practice, one died during his first practice while trying out for the team and six other players died during the first week of winter, spring or voluntary workouts, none of which are covered by the NCAA legislation.</p>

      <p>Also in 2003, the NCAA gave athletics training staff the “unchallengeable authority” to provide independent medical care and end unsafe workouts during voluntary offseason workouts. Yet, according to a survey conducted in 2019 by the National Athletic Trainers’ Association, nearly a quarter of college trainers still feel they do not have that authority.</p>

      <p>“If my existence here at the University of Oklahoma centers on keeping (head football coach) Lincoln Riley happy … at some point in time I’m not going to be making best interest medical decisions for our athletes,” Anderson said. “If the athletic director is ceding that authority to the coach over the medical providers, or the athletic director and athletic administration isn’t supporting the medical staff as they make those decisions, then we don’t have independent care.”</p>

      <p>In 2015, the NCAA began mandating strength and conditioning coaches from Division I programs attain professional accredited certification. But as a 2017 CBS Sports investigation found, strength coaches can gain their credentials in some questionable certification programs, including one that lasts just 21 hours. Court, the Maryland strength and conditioning coach who led the workout that resulted in McNair’s heatstroke, earned the title of “master” strength and conditioning coach in 2016. The CSCCa calls it “undoubtedly the highest honor” bestowed on strength and conditioning coaches.</p>

      <p>The college football season continued in 2020 despite the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 outbreaks around the country cancelled in-person classes and sent students home, but with billions of dollars on the line, all of the Power 5 Conferences played football games.</p>

      <p>The risk from sudden cardiac death has taken another turn during the pandemic, as myocarditis — inflammation of the heart — has emerged as a common condition in recovered COVID-19 patients. According to an Ohio State University study of 26 college athletes who had tested positive for the coronavirus, 15% showed signs of developing the condition. A 2015 study found that of 64 college athletes who died from cardiac arrest with a specific cause determined, 9% suffered from myocarditis.</p>

      <p>In 2016, a task force convened by the NCAA released a set of guidelines on cardiovascular care of student-athletes, including a recommendation to screen all athletes before they participate. Harmon, a coauthor of the document, said heart electrocardiograms, if properly performed and interpreted, can detect two-thirds to three-quarters of abnormalities that lead to death. Even the most exhaustive preventive measures will not detect every heart condition that could lead to death, she said.</p>

      <p>Not until 2019, a year after McNair died, did the NCAA release comprehensive guidelines on preventing sudden death in athletes from ailments such as brain injuries, spine injuries and asthma, as well as sudden cardiac arrest, exertional sickling collapse and exertional heatstroke. The document gives athletic programs a list of guidelines to follow, including refraining from using exercise punitively, making sure workouts are based in science and are sport-specific, and ensuring staff have emergency action plans to treat athletes with serious illnesses.</p>

      <p>Hainline, the NCAA’s chief medical officer, said the “most important” aspect of the 2019 best-practices document is a recommendation that strength and conditioning coaches no longer report to the head coaching staff but report to sports medicine personnel, ensuring independent medical care, reflecting a more important role for athletic trainers and physicians. The document also recommends institutions discipline coaches and staff that do not follow the guidelines.</p>

      <p>“This is not my belief today, but for a very long time (the NCAA) did not prioritize health and safety,” Casa said. “I think the NCAA has done more in the past three or four years than they did in the last hundred years prior.”</p>

      <p>The NCAA still does not have the power to hold programs or coaches accountable for pushing athletes past their limit. It is not against NCAA rules to do so.</p>

      <p>“They don’t want to pass any rules because they feel like if they pass a rule and something doesn’t get done right, somebody like me is going to go sue them,” Egdorf said. “And they’d rather have no rules and live with kids getting sick or die and risk getting sued.”</p>

      <p>Ole Miss lawyers defended the conditioning workout that led to Abram’s death by pointing out that any NCAA recommendation is not a “statute, ordinance, or regulation.”</p>

      <p>Player advocates like Egdorf and Huma will be unmoved by NCAA efforts until coaches and institutions face consequences.</p>

      <p>“This is not a matter of it being difficult to identify appropriate health and safety standards,” Huma said. “The problem is that these guidelines are not enforced. They’re not adopted as actual rules that are enforced, and no one's held accountable when they break these best practices.”</p>

      <p>A note on methodology:
      This story focuses on 22 NCAA Division I football players who died from an exertion-related illness suffered during a practice or conditioning session from 2000-2018. The primary causes of death for these incidents are sudden cardiac arrest, exertional sickling collapse and exertional heatstroke. One player died of an exercise-induced asthma attack. The story does not include players who died from sudden cardiac arrest unrelated to football practice or athletes who died from medical issues or accidents not tied to exertion. The research was based on cases gathered from publicly available court records, legislative reports, media reports and interviews.
